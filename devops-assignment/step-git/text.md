# Resolve the merge conflict!

There is a git repository under the git-assignment repository. In that repo
there is a README.md file.

There is a feature branch named `feature/JIRA-42` which tries to add some
formatting to the README.md file, but in the meanwhile somebody already edited
the content of the file and now there is a merge conflict!

Resolve the merge conflict to keep the content from the main branch but also
add the new formatting from the feature branch!
